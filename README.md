## Project Description

### This is a small project that leverages the Steam API to compare users Rust statistics.

## Whether youâ€™re a solo player or part of a group, you can use this app to keep track of your stats and compare them with other players.

### I have used Vue.js and Pinia to create this project. The bulk of the code to retrieve, compare and store stats can be seen within StatStore.ts. In addition, StatViewer.vue is the main component for rendering statistics to the page.

# Install Guide
